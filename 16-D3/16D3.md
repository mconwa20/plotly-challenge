# Unit 16-D3.js Additional Videos and Resources

Hi Everyone! I have put together an additional resource guide to complement the existing unit material and additional guides (VideoGuide.md and StudentGuide.md). I add to this guide whenever I find a new resource, so be sure to check back, or please send me (Madison) over a Slack message if you're looking for a topic in particular that may not be covered with the resources below! 

Not too many additional resources this week, as most JavaScript video guides are super comprehensive and go over everything you need to know to hit the ground running.
